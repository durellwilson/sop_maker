# Route Standardization

## The Problem

We identified an inconsistency in the routing structure of the SOP Maker application. The application was using two different parameter names for the same concept:

1. `/sop/[sopId]` routes in some files
2. `/sop/[id]` routes in others

This inconsistency caused confusion and potential routing issues, as well as duplicate file structures that performed the same functionality.

## The Solution

We standardized on using `/sop/[id]` for all routes by:

1. Updating all the code in the `[sopId]` files to use `id` instead of `sopId` as the parameter name
2. Copying the updated files to the `[id]` directory structure
3. Creating a cleanup script (`cleanup-routes.js`) to help with future standardization

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All routes now use the same parameter name, making the codebase more maintainable
- **Reduced duplication**: The application no longer has duplicated route handlers for the same routes
- **Better alignment with API routes**: The frontend routes now align with the API routes, which use `[id]`

## Cleanup Steps

1. Run the provided cleanup script: `node cleanup-routes.js`
2. Verify the application works correctly with the new routes 
3. Remove the old `[sopId]` directory structure: `rm -rf src/app/sop/[sopId]`
4. Update any references in other parts of the codebase to use the standardized route pattern

## Best Practices Going Forward

- Always use `[id]` as the parameter name for SOP routes
- Ensure new routes follow the established pattern
- Run linting and type checking to catch inconsistencies early
